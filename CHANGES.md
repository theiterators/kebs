## Version 1.8.1
> 15.09.2020

* Fixed issue https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/73

## Version 1.8.0

> 24.08.2020
* Fixed issue https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/67
* Dropped support for Scala 2.11

## Version 1.7.1

> 02.01.2020

* Bumped dependencies to fully support Scala 2.13
* Removed `avro4s` support as version 3 supports value types out of the box

## Version 1.6.3

> 17.07.2019

* Bumped dependencies to partially support Scala 2.13

## Version 1.6.2

> 03.09.2018

* Bumped `avro4s` dependency to `1.9.0`
* Added further Slick-extension methods: numeric and boolean. You can use numeric and boolean operators like `*` and `&&` on columns mapped by a case-class

## Version 1.6.1

> 04.06.2018

This version si the same as 1.6.0 - it only exists to publish Scala 2.11.x builds (erroneously omitted)

## Version 1.6.0

> 30.05.2018

* Tagged types!
* Fixed StackOverflowError when compiling recursive spray-formats under Scala 2.12.6 (once again issue https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/21)


## Version 1.5.4

> 14.03.2018

* Added support for `StringColumnExtensionMethods` so you can use eg. `toLowerCase` directly on columns mapped by a case-class

## Version 1.5.3

> 27.02.2018

* Fixed issue https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/21

## Version 1.5.2

> 31.01.2018

* Fixed issue https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/11
* Most projects do not use custom macros anymore, relying on single `CaseClass1Rep` instead. Same thing has been done to `enumeratum` macros.
This should lead to shorter compilation times
* `kebs-spray` has been rewritten - generation of `Spray` formats should incur less allocations

## Version 1.5.1

> 17.11.2017

* Add new isomorphisms helpful for Postgres HStore support
* `kebs-slick` now depends on Slick 3.2.1 (for both 2.11 and 2.12) - we don't have to check for potential ambiguity for `MappedProjection`
* `play-json` version bump to 2.6.7 (for both 2.11 and 2.12)

## Version 1.5.0

> 17.07.2017

This release adds new module `kebs-avro`

## Version 1.4.5

> 14.07.2017

* Fix bug in JSON support for case classes with more than 22 fields
(https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/16)
* There was a problem with mapping slick columns as sequences of EnumEntries - fixed

## Version 1.4.4

> 11.07.2017

* JSON - Support for case classes with more than 22 fields
(fixes https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/7)

## Version 1.4.3

> 23.05.2017

* Support for automatically generated mutually-recursive JSON formatters in `spray-json` 
(fixes https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/1)
* Support for choice between _flat_ and _non-flat_ serialization in `spray-json`
(fixes https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/3)
* Fixed 'Default Enum value is always used instead of the one passed in request' in `kebs-akka-http`
(fixes https://github.com/theiterators/kebs/issues/2)

## Version 1.4.2

> 07.05.2017

This release adds new module `kebs-akka-http` which generates `akka-http` unmarshallers for 1-element case classes and supports enumeratum

## Version 1.4.1

> 21.03.2017

Dependencies changed:
- `kebs-play-json` depends on `play-json` `2.5.13` in `2.11`; `1.6.0-M5` in `2.12`
- `kebs-slick`     depends on `slick`     `3.1.1`  in `2.11`; `3.2.0`    in `2.12`

It's safe to bump up slick to `3.2.0` manually if you are on `2.11` - `kebs-slick` does not depend on anything slick-version-specific

## Version 1.4.0

> 11.03.2017

This version adds support for Scala 2.12 (using `play-json 1.6.0-M4`)
* Support for `ValueEnumEntry` and `ValueEnum` for `slick` and `spray-json`
* Removed `play-json` support for `enumeratum` - use `enumeratum-play-json` instead


## Version 1.3.0

> 06.02.2017

First published version of `kebs`:
* Generation of slick mappers for 1-element case classes and lists
* Generation of `spray-json` formats for case classes
* Generation of `play-json` flat formats for 1-element case classes
* Support for `enumeratum` mappers in `slick`, `spray-json` and `play-json`
